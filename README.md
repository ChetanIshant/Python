# Python
Python repository covering core concepts and problem-solving. Built for learning, practice, and interview preparation.
Major focus of this repo is to crack technical interviews.

This repository contains my complete **Python learning and practicing journey**,  object-oriented programming, and mini projects.
The purpose of this repository is to build a **strong Python foundation**, practice coding regularly, and prepare for **technical interviews and real-world applications**.

# What This Repository Includes:
Python basics and core concepts
Conditional statements and loops
Functions and simple recursion
Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
Logic-based questions
Small Python scripts

Each file shows what I learned and practiced on that day.

# How to Run the Code
Make sure Python is installed on your system.
Run any file using:
python filename.py

This repository is not about perfection, but about consistent learning.

Suggestions and feedback are always welcome.
